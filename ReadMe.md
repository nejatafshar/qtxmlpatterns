# qtxmlpatterns

A fork of qtxmlpatterns library compiling with Qt6. The Qt XML Patterns module provides support for XPath, XQuery, XSLT, and XML Schema validation.

## Changes:

- Builds as a static lib without any dependency
- Only compiles with Qt6
- No need for Core5Compat module
- Improved code by replacing deprecated APIs with new ones
